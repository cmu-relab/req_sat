For consent to be freely given in the presence of a power imbalance, the controller must demonstrate that there is no detriment when consent is refused or later withdrawn. Recital 43 clearly indicates that it is unlikely that public authorities can rely on consent for processing as whenever the controller is a public authority, there is often a clear imbalance of power in the relationship between the controller and the data subject. There may be situations when it is possible for the employer to demonstrate that consent actually is freely given. Given the imbalance of power between an employer and its staff members, employees can only give free consent in exceptional circumstances, when it will have no adverse consequences at all whether or not they give consent.

For consent to be informed, it is necessary to inform the data subject of certain elements that are crucial to make a choice.
