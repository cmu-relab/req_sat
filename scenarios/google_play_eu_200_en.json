Its real power is the flexibility to combine contexts and tasks however you wish: https://tasker.joaoapps.com/exampleuses.html\u2611 AutomationsMake your phone a true smart phone! Why remember to change the volume every day when you leave home when your phone can do it for you?Automate stuff based on the app you&#39;re in, the time of day, your location, your Wi-Fi network, Received SMS or Calls, the currently playing song and many other (130+) states and events!Check out how easy it is to create an automation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6EAbLW5WSk\u2611 Actions350+ actions allow you to truly customize your phone like never before! Send SMS, create notifications, change almost any system setting like Wifi Tether, Dark Mode, Always On Display, change any volume, control Do Not Disturb, open apps, file manipulation, control music playback, get your location... you get the idea. If you can think of it, Tasker can probably do it for you!Note: root is NOT (I repeat NOT) required for majority of the functions. However, a few of the actions (like the Airplane Mode action and the Mobile Data action on some devices) require root. This is because of Android security policies that developers cannot work around.\u2611 Automatic File BackupsIf you set it up to do so, Tasker can automatically backup your files to a specific folder on the device, SD card, USB key or even Google Drive! This is useful if you want to keep your files safe even if you lose your phone. \u2611 Download and Install APKs directlyBy your request (if you set up a task to do so), Tasker can automatically check a website for updated APKs, receive those APKs from said websites and initiate installation of any files!\u2611 Other TriggersManually trigger your actions via launcher shortcuts, quick setting tiles, widgets, long-pressing volume buttons, media buttons (like the ones on your BT headsets or headphones), Bixby button, Navigation Bar, Notifications and more!\u2611 Join - Remote TaskerAdding Join (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joaomgcd.join) to the mix will even allow you to trigger tasks from another Android device or PC!\u2611 ScenesDesign your own UI and use it to display any info you want or trigger any task!\u2611 App CreationCreate your own standalone apps to share or sell with the Tasker App Factory : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.appfactory\u2611 Developer FriendlyMany 3rd party developers already allow you to perform actions in their apps and listen to their events/states through Tasker!Check out some of them: https://tasker.joaoapps.com/pluginlist.htmlYou can also call most of the Web APIs from Tasker with the powerful HTTP Auth and HTTP Request actions!

Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and easy visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided meditation, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.In hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges partly because it sounds nicer but also because \u2018surge\u2019 more accurately describes the sensation you\u2019ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the play store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind - using appropriate terminology - but can be used by all.You can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective the audio will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. And the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce which helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable.You can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Parenting can be hard but you\u2019ve got Freya; she\u2019s your friend for life!

The central Hungarian entrance exam is basically competency-based, but in order to achieve a good result, you also need a background knowledge of grammar and literature, which can be easily practiced with the application and gives you the opportunity to gain extra points. There are currently more than 2,100 questions in the application, dividing knowledge into 8 larger units: Sounds, Words, Parts of Sentences, Spelling, Grammar and language games, Sayings and proverbs, Literary knowledge and Extra content. The questions are adapted to the curriculum of the Hungarian language and literature subject in elementary school, as well as to the admission tasks of previous years. When creating the application, we paid particular attention to making it interesting and enjoyable for students to use, as well as to allow them to practice through examples used in everyday language and song lyrics. In the Extra contents, we provide tips and advice for the reading comprehension and writing tasks of the admission, as well as for the admission process in general. Preparation for the central Hungarian admission is a period full of excitement for all students, requiring a long preparation process. However, the mobile phone is in the pocket of every applicant, so even in their free minutes, sitting on a train or bus, they can prepare for the entrance exam and learn grammatical and literary knowledge that they can successfully recall while writing the entrance exam list. The application is available on mobile devices with the Android operating system (phone, tablet) at a one-time price of HUF 3,590 - i.e. it is not a subscription, but the application can be used for an unlimited time after downloading.
