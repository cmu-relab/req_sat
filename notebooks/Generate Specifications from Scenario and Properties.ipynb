For consent to be freely given in the presence of a power imbalance, the controller must demonstrate that there is no detriment when consent is refused or later withdrawn.

There may be situations when it is possible for the employer to demonstrate that consent actually is freely given. Given the imbalance of power between an employer and its staff members, employees can only give free consent in exceptional circumstances, when it will have no adverse consequences at all whether or not they give consent.

For consent to be informed, it is necessary to inform the data subject of certain elements that are crucial to make a choice. Therefore, the EDPB is of the opinion that at least the following information is required for obtaining valid consent: i. the controller’s identity, ii. the purpose of each of the processing operations for which consent is sought, iii. what (type of) data will be collected and used, iv. the existence of the right to withdraw consent, v. information about the use of the data for automated decision-making in accordance with Article 22 (2)(c) where relevant, and on the possible risks of data transfers due to absence of an adequacy decision and of appropriate safeguards as described in Article 46.',\n",

The user appreciates the easy-to-understand metrics and weather symbols provided by the app, which help them make informed decisions about their flight plan. They also find the crosswind calculations and flight rule categories helpful. After customizing the units to their preference, the user listens to the voice synthesis reading of the weather details and notes the sunrise and sunset times for their journey. The app utilizes the user's location and weather preferences to deliver accurate and personalized weather updates, making it a valuable tool for aviation weather forecasting.\",\n",
       " 'prop-actions': '1. The app allows the user to easily customize their consent preferences for data processing related to weather updates by providing a dedicated settings section that clearly outlines the options for opting in or out of specific data processing activities.\\n\\n2. The user can access a clear and concise privacy policy within the app that details how their data is used for weather forecasting purposes and explicitly states their right to withdraw consent at any time.\\n\\n3. Upon opening the app, the user receives a notification reminding them of their right to withdraw consent for data processing, with a direct link to the settings where they can easily make changes to their consent preferences.\\n\\n4. The app automatically logs the timestamp and type of consent given by the user, ensuring that the withdrawal process is as seamless and transparent as possible.\\n\\n5. The user can easily navigate to a dedicated section within the app where they can review and manage their consent settings, including the option to withdraw consent with just a few taps or clicks.\\n\\n6. In case the user decides to withdraw consent, the app immediately stops processing their data for weather updates and notifies the user of the successful withdrawal.\\n\\n7. The app periodically reminds the user of their right to withdraw consent and provides helpful tips on how to easily adjust their settings if needed.\\n\\n8. The user receives an email confirmation after withdrawing consent, reassuring them that their decision has been successfully processed and their data will no longer be used for weather forecasting purposes.\\n\\n9. The app ensures that the withdrawal process is not hidden or buried within complex menus, making it easy for the user to find and exercise their right to withdraw consent at any given time.\\n\\n10. The user can easily re-enable consent for data processing at any time through a straightforward process within the app, ensuring that they have full control over their privacy preferences.',\n",
